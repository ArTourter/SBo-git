Osmo is a handy personal organizer which includes calendar, task manager 
and address book modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and 
good looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information.

Optional build-time dependencies are libnotify, libsyncml, and libtar.
libgringotts, which is not available at SlackBuilds.org, is also optional.

wavemon is a ncurses-based monitor for wireless devices. It allows you to 
watch the signal and noise levels, packet statistics, device configuration, 
and network parameters of your wireless network hardware. It has currently 
only been tested with the Lucent Orinoco series of cards, although it
should work (with varying features) with all devices supported by the 
wireless kernel extensions.

XaoS is an interactive fractal zoomer. It allows the user to continuously
to zoom in or out of a fractal in a fluid, continuous motion. This
capability makes XaoS great for exploring fractals, and itâ€™s just
plain fun!

Note to users of 64-bit and other non-x86 Slackware derivatives: if
you want to be able to define your own fractal formulae, you'll need
to install the GSL library, and run xaos.SlackBuild with USE_GSL=yes
in the environment. Without GSL, you'll be limited to the fractals that
are built in to the program (which is fine for most users anyway).

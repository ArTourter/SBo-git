Gecko Mediaplayer is the modern replacement for the mplayerplug-in 
application.

It is a browser plugin that uses GNOME MPlayer to play media in a browser. 
It should work with all browsers on Unix-ish systems(Linux, BSD, Solaris) 
and uses the NS4 API (Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

gnome-mplayer is required to use this software.

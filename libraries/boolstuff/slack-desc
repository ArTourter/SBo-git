# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

boolstuff: boolstuff (library to perform operations on boolean expressions)
boolstuff:
boolstuff: boolstuff is a C++ library that supports a few operations on boolean
boolstuff: expression binary trees. The main features are:
boolstuff: * a simple boolean expression parser
boolstuff: (supports operators AND, OR and NOT, as well as parentheses);
boolstuff: * an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into its
boolstuff: Disjunctive Normal Form (this algorithm supports the NOT operator);
boolstuff: * a function that determines if an expression tree is in DNF.

pulseaudio is a networked sound server for Unix-like operating systems
and Microsoft Windows. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement 
for the Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESOUND).

Pulseaudio will need a pulse group/user to run. You can add one with
	# groupadd -g 216 pulse
	# useradd -u 216 -g pulse -d /var/lib/pulse pulse
or something similar.  See http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt

Pulseaudio requires libatomic_ops, libsamplerate, and libsndfile.
It will also make use of jack-audio-connection-kit.  All of these 
dependencies are available at SlackBuilds.org.

All the official MythTV plugins, including MythArchive, MythControls, MythDVD,
MythFlix, MythGallery, MythGame, MythMusic, MythNews, MythPhone, MythVideo, 
MythWeather, and MythWeb.

This requires mythtv, xmltv_prereq, and lame.

Some of these plugins require extra work to get them functional.  See the 
README files in /usr/doc/mythplugins for extra steps, configuration, and 
dependencies.

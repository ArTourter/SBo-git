Halevt (HAL events manager) is a daemon that executes arbitrary commands when a
device with certain properties is added to the system and when device properties
change. Halevt uses HAL to monitor the state of your system's hardware.  The 
design of Halevt is heavily based on ivman.

Halevt can also report all the hal events that are emitted by hald
(with the -i option on the command line).  Halevt comes with halevt-mount:
a program able to use HAL to mount, umount devices, and keep a list of 
devices handled by halevt-mount.

Some of the examples require gtkdialog or Xdialog (SlackBuilds available)
and alltray (not available yet for Slackware 13.0)

This requires boolstuff.

Miro is a free Internet television application for the online
Democracy Network.

Requires gst-python and gnome-python-extras.

Optional dependencies are libtorrent-rasterbar and notify-python.
If libtorrent-rasterbar is not installed, then Miro will install
libtorrent-rasterbar 0.14.4. Fortunately, this will not interfere
with libtorrent-rasterbar if installed later.

See README.runtime for additional runtime requirements.

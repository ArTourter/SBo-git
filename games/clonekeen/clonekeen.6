.SH NAME
clonekeen \- Clone of id Software's "Commander Keen" game
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clonekeen
[\fIwarplevel\fR]
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
CloneKeen is an almost almost complete open\-source clone of
the old classic DOS game, \fICommander Keen: Invasion of the
Vorticons\fR by ID Software. CloneKeen requires the original game
data files to work. You can play all three episodes of the game
(but not the later episodes 4 through 6, nor "Keen Dreams").
.PP
CloneKeen tries to mostly replicate the original game,
however there are also a number of improvements,
including smoother scrolling, better graphic effects
in some parts of the game, and 2\-player support.
.PP
See story.txt for a description of the game's plot.

When you are on the Mars map, you may be blocked by a city, shrine, or other
obstacle.  You must enter the city (press Ctrl) and finish it
before proceeding.
.PP
When you enter a city, you can get things by simply running into them.
.PP
If you cannot pass through a door, there may be a "keycard" that the door
requires.  This keycard will be the same color as the door.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fB~/.clonekeen\fR
Per\-user savegames and config data. This directory is created the first
time you run \fBclonekeen\fR.
.TP
\fB~/.clonekeen/defaultargs\fR
Default arguments to pass to the game. Good candidates are \-fs, \-dbl,
and/or -cheat. Put the arguments in the file on the same line,
separated by spaces, e.g.:
.PP
\fBecho "-dbl -fs -cheat" > ~/.clonekeen/defaultargs\fR
.TP
\fB/usr/share/games/clonekeen/\fR
System\-wide game data files (including the ones that come with
the original game). Data files may be named in all\-uppercase or
all\-lowercase (EGAHEAD.CK1 or egahead.ck1, or even mixed case like
EGAHEAD.ck1 or egahead.CK1, but not egaHead.ck1)
.TP
\fB/usr/games/clonekeen\-bin\fR
Main game binary. Generally not to be run directly: it expects to find the
data files in the current dir, and writes config/savegame data in the
current dir. Use the \fBclonekeen\fR wrapper script instead.
.TP
\fB/usr/games/clonekeen\fR
Wrapper script.  Creates ~/.clonekeen, populates it with symlinks to the
game data files, runs the main binary.
.SH BUGS
Actually not bugs, these are features that were in the original DOS version
of the game that are not (yet?) implemented in clonekeen:
.PP
No way to customize keyboard controls
.PP
No support for joystick controls
.PP
No support for in\-game help (probably just as well, the help talks about
joysticks, and customizing keyboard controls...)
.PP
Also, the DOS build of clonekeen appears to support up to 4 (or maybe
only 3) player
games, but the Linux build only defines enough control keys
for 2 players.

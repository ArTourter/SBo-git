get_iplayer allows you to search, index and record/stream:

    * BBC iPlayer TV - up to 3200 kbps HD 720p H.264 / Quicktime / MP4
    * BBC Live TV - 500 kbps H.264 / MP4
    * BBC iPlayer Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC and Realaudio
    * BBC Live Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC, WMA and Realaudio
    * BBC Podcasts - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC
    * BBC iPlayer TV subtitles - SubRip / srt

It emulates an iPhone from the BBC's server's point of view, thus allowing
the download of DRM-free H.264 feeds. 

Requires perl-html-parser and libwww-perl (available at SlackBuilds.org).
Optionally depends on flvstreamer (also available at SlackBuilds.org). This
is a recommended optional dependency as not all streams are available in 
H.264 format, and flvstreamer allows get_iplayer to download the Adobe 
Flash files instead.

This build does not include to PVR components (yet).

clusterresourceagents (OCF Resource Agents for HA-Linux)

OCF resource agents for use by compatible cluster managers (formerly
part of Heartbeat). Basically, just another core and required
component of the Linux-HA (i.e. heartbeat/pacemaker/openais/corosync)
software stack.

In order to have a functioning High Availability software stack,
before running this SlackBuild, build AND install, each in order,
the following other SlackBuilds.

Requires: libnet, libesmtp, clusterglue, available at SlackBuilds.org.

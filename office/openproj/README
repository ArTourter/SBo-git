OpenProj - an open source project managing office application

OpenProj is a desktop replacement for Microsoft Project. It is capable of
sharing files with Microsoft Project and has very similar functionality 
(Gantt, PERT diagram, histogram, charts, reports, detailed usage), as well as 
tree views which aren't in MS Project.

OpenProj uses Sun Java Runtime Environment (jre) version 1.5 or later, though
at least 1.6 is preferred.  Slackware does include jre.

Dependencies to compile this SlackBuild:

apache-ant	available from www.slackbuilds.org

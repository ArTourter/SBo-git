These are the 32bit libraries of NVidia video driver for the X.Org
X-server. This package is needed only on multilib x86_64 slackware.

Since this nvidia-driver conflicts with some files of xorg, it's a bit
complex to install/uninstall the driver.  However, installation of the
nvidia-driver package itself backs up the conflicting files and puts the
nvidia-specific files into place.

Heinz Wiesinger, the author of the build script, has written a script called
nvidia-switch (that has been modified by lumak of linuxquestions.org to
nvidia-switch-32), which is used to switch between the stock xorg driver and
the nvidia driver, but it will not edit xorg.conf for you; you have to do
that manually.  The nvidia-switch-32 script is installed to /usr/sbin.

Usage of nvidia-switch-32:
  nvidia-switch-32 --xorg	 <-->  switch to the stock xorg files
  nvidia-switch-32 --nvidia  <--> switch to the proprietary nvidia files
  nvidia-switch-32 --cleanup <--> switch to the stock xorg file and remove all
	symlinks created by nvidia-switch-32

You do NOT have to run nvidia-switch-32 after installing or upgrading the
package. ONLY if you want to explicitely switch to the xorg files,
afterwards switching back to nvidia files or before uninstalling the
package.

No special steps are necessary when updating nvidia-driver from a previous
package. If you update to a newer xorg, you do not have to reinstall
nvidia-driver either. Just run "nvidia-switch-32 --nvidia" in that case.

Before uninstalling this package, it is important that you execute
'nvidia-switch-32 --cleanup', which will switch back to the stock xorg files
and remove all links created by nvidia-switch-32 before.
If you forget to do this, you'll have to do the switch manually, or xorg
won't work on next startup.  Here are the affected files:
  /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2
  /usr/include/GL/{gl.h glx.h glxext.h glext.h}
  /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/{libglx.so libglx.la}

This also requires the nvidia-kernel and the nvidia-driver packages from
SlackBuilds.org.

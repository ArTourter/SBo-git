Google Chrome (Open Source Web Browser)

This script will repackage the debian binary. The snapshot is updated
daily, so the MD5SUM and VERSION numbers are not likely to match.

You can disable plugin (flash, etc) support by running the script:
PLUGINS=no ./google-chrome.SlackBuild
Default is yes (enabled). This is a simple change to the .desktop file.

This requires GConf, and seamonkey-solibs from Slackware's patches.

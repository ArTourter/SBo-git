Go-oo is a fork of the OpenOffice.org Office Suite.

Go-oo has built in OpenXML  import filters and it will import your Microsoft
Works files. Compared with up-stream OO.o, it has better Microsoft binary
file support (with eg. fields  support), and it will import WordPerfect
graphics beautifully. If you are reliant on Excel VBA macros - then Go-oo
offers the best macro fidelity too. If you expect your spreadsheets to
calculate compatibly, or you get embedded Visio diagrams in your documents,
you'll want Go-oo.

NOTE: This build needs a few gig in $TMP and the source is about 400 meg
to download. It also takes hours to compile. This build is still a WIP
due to the long build time it is very hard to QA test.

This requires xulrunner, Archive-Zip, icu4c, apache-ant, jdk from /extra,
  and seamonkey2 from /patches in Slackware.

Optional requirements are avahi, openclipart, ORBit2, GConf, and gnome-vfs.

Variables that can be passed to the SlackBuild script:
ARTPATH     Path to openclipart, leave unset to disable.
NVIDIA=no   Turns off an nvidia build work around.
LINGUAS_OOO Sets the languages to add.
PLUGIN=no   Disable openoffice's mozilla plugin.
KDE=no      Disable KDE4 UI.
GTK=no      Disable GTK UI.
GNOME=yes   Enables optioal gnome bits.
MYCONF      Used to pass extra configure options.

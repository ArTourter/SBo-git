# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-extutils-depends: ExtUtils::Depends (perl module)
perl-extutils-depends: 
perl-extutils-depends: This module tries to make it easy to build Perl 
perl-extutils-depends: extensions that use functions and typemaps provided 
perl-extutils-depends: by other perl extensions. This means that a perl 
perl-extutils-depends: extension is treated like a shared library that
perl-extutils-depends: provides a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.

OpenCT implements drivers for several smart card readers.  It comes as
driver in ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or as
a small and lean middleware, so applications can use it with minimal
overhead. OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism to export smart card
readers to remote machines via TCP/IP.

This requires pcsc-lite.

Compiling with "HALD=1 ./openct.SlackBuild" enable smart-card reader
detection using hal daemon's .fdi files instead of the default use of
udev rules.  Compiling with "NONPRIV=1 ./openct.SlackBuild" enables
non-privileged mode, but you may need to modify /etc/rc.d/rc.openctd 
to allow 'chown' to change user/group.

See README.SBo for further information.

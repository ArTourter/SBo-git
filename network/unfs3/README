UNFS3 is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server specification.
It provides a daemon for the MOUNT and NFS protocols, which are used by
NFS clients for accessing files on the server.

It can be configured to run under an unprivileged user account, can
password protect its exports (even with one-time passwords), and supports
ClusterNFS' file tagging features.

unfsd conflicts with knfsd (the kernel-mode NFS server) if both are
to listen on the same port, which defaults to 2049.

Slackware Linux ships with knfsd. To use this NFS server instead,
make sure /etc/rc.d/rc.unfsd is executable and /etc/rc.d/rc.nfsd is not.
For auto-start at machine boot add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	# Start the NFSv3 service
	if [ -x /etc/rc/d/rc.unfsd ]; then
		/etc/rc/d/rc.unfsd start
	fi

The RPC portmapper must be first started, implying exec perms on rc.rpc

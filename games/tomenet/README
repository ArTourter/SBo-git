Tales of Middle Earth Multiplayer is a fantasy adventure game
 
TomeNET is a multiplayer fantasy dungeon exploration game based on the works of
J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a game that emphasizes intricate, challenging, and varied
gameplay over graphics. Hundreds of different monsters in randomly-generated,
unpredictable dungeons will strive to slay you by various means.

The game is installed in /usr/share/games/tomenet, where the configuration
files are.  The SlackBuild links the clients (for playing) into /usr/games and
the server and administration utilities into /usr/bin.  Slackware already puts
these places in your path, so you can type the name of the programs anywhere
and run them.  The client is called tomenet (for the X Window system).

The server and administration utliities are: 
  tomenetd
  tomenetd.evilmeta (for joining the list of public servers)
  tomenetd.accedit (to edit user accounts.)
  tomenet.console (somewhat of a client that is an admin tool.)

Just type in the client name and it will give you a list of servers.  If you
want to run one, type tomenetd and--if you want it public--tomenetd.evilmeta.
The tomenet.accedit will let you set what type of account (normal, Dungeon
Master, admin) specific users get who connect.

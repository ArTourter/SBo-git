MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics.  
It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of 
a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page 
on screen.

This requires ftjam or jam (both are available at SlackBuilds.org)

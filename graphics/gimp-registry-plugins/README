The GIMP Registry provides a location for GIMP plugins and scripts. These 
are individual projects to a certain extent, though they all have the 
GIMP in common.

This package takes its cue from the Debian gimp-registry-plugins 
package, though there are some differences as the scripts included
here are largely those which I wanted to use. If you want any 
particular plugins from the GIMP registry included, drop me an 
email.

Below is a list of the plugins/scripts included and any dependencies. 
The only dependency is Refocus for Smart sharpen (redux) optional. 
However, this won't build on 13.0 anyway. I mention this only for
completeness. If anyone can get Refocus to build, that'd be great.

* Add Film Grain  * Contact Sheet  * Diana/Holga2  * Exposure Blend
* GREYCstoration  * Fake high dynamic range effect # catchy name, eh? ;)
* Smart sharpen (redux) - optionally requires Refocus (no build available yet)
* Rays of Light  * Vignette Script

The scripts can be found as follows in the GIMP:
"Rays of Light" is in Filters > Alpha to Logo.
"Vignette" is in Filters > Light and Shadow.
"GREYCstoration" is in Filters > Enhance.
The rest of the plugins can be found in either
   Filters > Registry Plug-Ins
or
   Filters > Photography

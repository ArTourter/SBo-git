# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dwdiff: dwdiff (word-level front-end for diff)
dwdiff:
dwdiff: dwdiff is a front-end for the diff program that operates at the word
dwdiff: level instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that
dwdiff: it allows the user to specify what should be considered whitespace,
dwdiff: and in that it takes an optional list of characters that should
dwdiff: be considered delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that
dwdiff: are treated as if they are words, even when there is no whitespace
dwdiff: separating them from preceding words or delimiters.

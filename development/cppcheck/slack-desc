# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cppcheck: Cppcheck (A tool for static C/C++ code analysis)

cppcheck: Cppcheck is an analysis tool for C/C++ code. Unlike C/C++ compilers
cppcheck: and many other analysis tools, we don't detect syntax errors. Cppcheck
cppcheck: only detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally fail to
cppcheck: detect. The goal is no false positives.

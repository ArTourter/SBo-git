html2ps converts HTML pages to PostScript documents.  The HTML code can be 
retrieved from one or more URL:s or local files, specified as parameters on 
the command line. If no parameter is given, html2ps reads from standard input.

This package also includes xhtml2ps, a graphical front-end for html2ps.

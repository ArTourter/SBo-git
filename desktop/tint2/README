tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
also work with other window managers. It's based off ttm code.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and
compliance with freedesktop specifications.

imlib2 is required (it is also available at SlackBuilds.org).

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint2/tint2rc is copied to ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc.
This is used as the configuration. Other samples are included in
/usr/doc/tint2-*/sample that may also be used; you can edit
~/.config/tint2/tint2rc to your preference.

medit the text editor

Started originally as a simple built-in editor component in GGAP, it grew up
to a real text editor.

The intention now is to make it a useful programming and around-programming
text editor.

Features
    * Configurable syntax highlighting.
    * Configurable keyboard accelerators.
    * Multiplatform - works both on unix and windows.
    * Plugins: can be written in C or Python.
    * Configurable tools available from the main and context menus. They can
      be written in Python, or it can be a shell script, or in MooScript -
      simple builtin scripting lanugage.
    * Regular expression search/replace, grep and find frontends, builtin file
      selector and whatnot.

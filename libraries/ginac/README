GiNaC is a C++ library. Its design is revolutionary in a sense that contrary 
to other CAS it does not try to provide extensive algebraic capabilities and 
a simple programming language but instead accepts a given language (C++) and 
extends it by a set of algebraic capabilities. 
The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for GiNaC is 
Not a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. 

This requires cln.

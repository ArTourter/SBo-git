haskell-terminfo (Haskell bindings to the terminfo library)

This library provides an interface to the terminfo database (via bindings
to the curses library).  Terminfo allows POSIX systems to interact with a 
variety of terminals using a standard set of capabilities.

This requires ghc.

When uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg unregister terminfo

This Yahoo! client for Linux operating system supports almost
all of the features you would expect to find on the official
Windows Yahoo! client: Voice chat, webcams, faders, 'nicknames',
audibles, avatars, display images, and more. Yet, it remains
very light-weight and memory-friendly.

An optional requirement is libnotify; if you have it installed,
then run the script with:  USE_LIBNOTIFY=yes ./gyachi.SlackBuild

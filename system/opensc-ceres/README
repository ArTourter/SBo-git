This package provides opensc support for FNMT CERES cards.

Unfortunately, the developer (FNMT) does not provide the source code for 
this software, but only binary packages for certain distributions. 
Therefore, we just repackage the official binaries for Debian.

If you use firefox, you must manually register /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so 
(or /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs.11.so) as a security device in firefox.

This requires pcsc-lite, pcsc-tools, pcsc-perl, ccid, openct, and opensc.

Note: opensc-0.11.7 is shown as a required dependency according to the
upstream author of this software; your mileage may vary, especially since
we (SlackBuilds.org) currently have a newer version than that, and we
probably won't be reverting it in order to satisfy the requirements of
a binary-only package.

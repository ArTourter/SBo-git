Recorder is a graphical frontend of cdrkit/cdrtools, cdrdao, mkisofs
and growisofs. It aims to be simple and easy to use, free of large
configurations and useless options, following the KISS principle and
offering a disc burning of quality, nothing more.

Optionally depends on mpg123 (in /extra) and vcdimager (available from
SlackBuilds.org).

exo-notify contains the exo-mount-notify binary that is created when
compiling exo against libnotify. All other exo files are included in
the official Slackware Xfce package.

libnotify is required to build exo-notify.

NOTE: The version of exo used to build exo-notify must match the
version of exo included with Slackware's Xfce package.

The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the desktop as elegant,
consistent and colorful as possible. The current goal is to allow full
color customization of themes, icons, GDM logins and splash screens.
There are already seven full color-schemes available; Noble (Purple),
Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red), Dust (Chocolate), Illustrious
(Pink) and Wise (Green).
GNOME-Colors is mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary,
Tango-Generator and many other open-source projects.

If you want to have extras themes; Carbonite (dark grey) and Tribute
(light grey) - put the gnome-color-extras archive (of the same 
version!) in the path with SlackBuild.

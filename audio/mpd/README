Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. 
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that 
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes 
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, 
like frontend options, or restart X often.

Some optional dependencies include libshout, libmms, libsamplerate,
libmpcdec, lame, faac, faad2, ffmpeg, and jack.  

NOTE:  You will have to create the ~/.mpd/playlists directory manually.
Also be sure to edit the config file (/etc/mpd.conf) if needed before 
running the daemon.  

If save status isn't working properly when killing, try "killall -TERM mpd", 
and that should resolve the problem.

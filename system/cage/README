cage was wtitten to be a creator of unbreakable padded cells for untrusted
applications. It can be used to chroot programs that want to run as root.
For that to work though either sysvinit or the kernel need to be patched and
recompiled (instructions on how to go about this are included in /usr/doc).

However since filesystem capabilities are implemented it can also be used
as a 'su' command with inheritance support, similar to the 'capsh' command
from the libcap package (but featuring chroot support). See README.SLACKWARE

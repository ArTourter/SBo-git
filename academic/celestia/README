A real-time space simulation that lets you experience our universe
in three dimensions.

There are four frontend possibilities to choose. The Glut one works
out of the box. The GTK frontend needs gtkglext (also available
from SlackBuilds.org). The Gnome frontend wasn't tested.
The KDE frontend requires kde3 and will not work with the kde3 compat
packages.

Celestia may use lua for its script engine, if available at compile time.
Lua is also available from SlackBuilds.org.

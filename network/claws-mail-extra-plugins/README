                attachments.

* mailmbox: Handles mbox format mailboxes.

                       unread mail.

    Claw's addressbook
* tnef_parse: Enables reading application/ms-tnef attachments.

Requirements:
  The fancy plugin requires webkit.
  The geolocation plugin requires libchamplain.
  The notification plugin requires libnotify.
  The SynCE plugin requires libsynce and librapi2.

Note: By default the package will include every plugin; this can be changed
very easily in the script - it uses a list of plugins to be built, and plugins
can be added or removed easily enough.

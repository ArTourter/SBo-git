Glest is a free 3D real-time strategy game, where you control the armies of 
two different factions: Tech, which is mainly composed of warriors and 
mechanical devices, and Magic, that prefers mages and summoned creatures 
in the battlefield.

This requires glest-data, xerces-c, lua, jam, and OpenAL.
Optional build requirements: wxPython.
Optional addons: glest-megapack.

According to the manpage, you should go into the Options menu and run 
"Auto config" before the first time you play the game.

If you'd like to compile wxPython to have the additional map editor 
(ie. glest_editor) then pass HAVE_WX=yes to the script: 
  HAVE_WX=yes ./glest.SlackBuild

The map editor will only build with wxPython. If you pass HAVE_WX=yes 
and have wxGTK installed then the slackbuild will fail.

Additional translations can be added to glest from:
http://www.glest.org/files/contrib/translations/
Just unzip the file(s) and put the appropriate *.lng file into
/usr/share/glest/data/lang/ directory. It will be automatically picked 
up at next game play.

Note: According to the readme_linux.txt file, glest doesn't seem to work 
with the mesa drivers. Using the ATI or NVIDIA drivers will work. For any 
additional game-specific issues, see readme_linux.txt in the docs directory.

OBLIGE is a random level generator for various classic games, such as
DOOM and DOOM II (more coming soon). The goal is to produce high quality
levels which are fun to play.

This requires lua, fltk, and glbsp.

A Doom engine is required if you actually want to play the levels you
generate (currently, prboom and zdoom are available at SBo).

Also required: the doom.wad or doom2.wad from the registered (not
shareware) version of either Doom or Doom II.

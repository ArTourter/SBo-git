KmyMoney 2 is a simple financial accounting manager for KDE for personal or
small-business use. It is a full double-entry accounting software package.

The ultimate objectives of KMyMoney are...
* Familiar Features. KMyMoney intends to provide all important features
found in the commercially-available, personal finance managers. The
current release is closer than ever to that goal and more improvements
are already planned or being tested.
* Ease of use. KMyMoney strives to be the easiest open source personal
finance manager to use, especially for the non-technical user.
* Accuracy. Using time tested double entry accounting principles KMyMoney
can help ensure that your finances are kept in correct order.

IF you want to enable support for ofxbanking, you need to have libofx
installed (a build script for this is available at SlackBuilds.org), and
start the script with this: OFX=YES ./kmymoney2.SlackBuild
KMyMoney2 is personal financial tool, easy to use.

KMyMoney2 is still a KDE3 application, so to compile/use it on Slackware 13.0,
the KDE3 compatibility libraries from kde-compat are required.

pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits
normal users to mount removable devices without a matching entry in
/etc/fstab.

The program also includes "pmount-hal" which reads information from
hal (device labels, mount options) and passes them to pmount.

After installing pmount, make sure that the users you want to be able 
to use it are in the "plugdev" group.

IMWheel is a universal mouse wheel and mouse stick translator for the X
Windows System.  Using  either  a  special  version  of  gpm  and  it's
/dev/gpmwheel  FIFO, or the support for a ZAxis on the mouse built into
some servers, such as XFree86.  Utilizing the input from gpm or X  Win-
dows,  imwheel translates mouse wheel and mouse stick actions into key-
board events using the XTest extension to X.  Use xdpyinfo for informa-
tion on the supported extensions in your X server.

This build script has a patch that disables the configurator appearing
when you mouse up and down on the root window. I did this because it
stopped the ability for workspace changing in fluxbox and other WMs
and it would also pop up at the most annoying times ;)

The configurator window can still be found however with the -c switch.

To stop this patch from applying you only need edit the line in the
slackbuild script.

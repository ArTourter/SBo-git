amSynth stands for Analogue Modeling SYNTHesizer.

It provides virtual analogue synthesis in the style of the classic
Moog Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and
synth engine, while still creating varied sounds.

This requires gtkmm.  Optional dependencies are libsndfile and jack.

Avant Window Navigator (Awn)
 
Avant Window Navigator is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of the screen. 
It has support for launchers, task lists, and thirdy party applets.
 
This requires pyxdg, GConf, and ORBit2.

Note:  
This has been tested with xfce4.  To use Awn rather than xfce4-panel, you can:

- Launch xfce
- Enable display compositing from: Settings/Window Manager Tweaks 
- Launch a Terminal and execute: killall xfce4-panel
- Run: avant-window-navigator &
- Log Out saving the current session

To add launchers on the panel you have to select "Add" in the "Launchers" 
section of Awn Manager (you will have to restart the dock) or you can edit 
~/.config/awn/launchers directory adding more entries.

Tips:
To run more than one instance of an application on the panel, "middle-click" 
the launcher.

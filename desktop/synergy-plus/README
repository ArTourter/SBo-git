Synergy+ (synergy-plus) lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers with different operating systems, without
special hardware. All you need is a LAN connection. It's intended
for users with multiple computers, where each system uses its own
display. It's a little like having a 2nd or a 3rd desktop.

This build can co-exist with an existing synergy installation if
SYNERGYOLD is set to yes. This is set to no by default as synergy has
not been updated in some two and a half years.

If SYNERGYOLD is set to yes, the two binaries synergyc (client)
and synergys (server) are suffixed with -plus to synergyc-plus and
synergys-plus.

An example configuration file (synergy.conf) can be found in 
/usr/doc/synergy-plus-1.3.4/.

The Snack Sound Toolkit is designed to be used with a scripting language such as Tcl/Tk or Python.
Using Snack you can create powerful multi-platform audio applications with just a few lines of code.
Snack has commands for basic sound handling, such as playback, recording, file and socket I/O.
Snack also provides primitives for sound visualization, e.g. waveforms and spectrograms.

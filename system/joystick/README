jscal (a joystick calibration program, not to be confused with jscalibrator),
jstest and jsattach are 3 command-line tools which were included in Version 1
of the Linux Joystick Driver.

The included patch for jscal adds remapping axes and buttons functionality.

If you wish to remap your joystick axes and/or buttons, run jscal with the -q
option: the output is a line of text containing the "jscal -u" (remap) command
with the current mappings, which you can save to a file and edit to suit your
needs.

This is a disk protection user-space daemon for IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads.
It monitors the acceleration values through the HDAPS interface and
automatically initiates disk head parking if a fall or sliding of the
laptop is detected. 

If you would like to use the latest source when building your
hdapsd package, you will need to get it from their git server.
In order to do that, use the included hdapsd-mksrctarball.sh
script, which will download the source code and will create
a compressed tarball using today's date (YYYYMMDD) as its version string.
To use your newly download source, you will need to tell the SlackBuild
to use it like so:  VERSION=YYYYMMDD ./hdapsd.SlackBuild

Be sure to see README.SLACKWARE for usage information.

This requires tp_smapi.

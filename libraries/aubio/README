aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing
pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio. The name aubio comes from 'audio' with a typo:
several transcription errors are likely to be found in the
results too.

aubio requires libsndfile, libsamplerate and fftw. It makes
also use of jack-audio-connection-kit, if available. All
of which are available from SlackBuilds.org.

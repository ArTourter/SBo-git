vobcopy copies .vob files from DVD to hard drives.  I primarily needs
libdvdread but also used libdvdcss (if available) for encrypted dvds.
Please refer README or manpages in the package for usage info.

vobcopy requires libdvdread (available at SBo).  Optional dependency is
libdvdcss for encrypted dvds (also available at SBo).

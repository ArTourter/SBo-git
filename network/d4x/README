Downloader For X (or simply D4X) is a download manager/accelerator
for Unix-like systems.

Note: By default, the slackbuild script has sound functionality turned
off.  This can be enabled by passing the following to the slackbuild:
D4X_LIBAO=yes ./d4x.SlackBuild

D4X has been know to freeze up when sound is turned on.  To alleviate this
then create a file /etc/libao.conf, or alternatively ~/.libao, and put in it:
default_driver=alsa

In case alsa isn't your default audio driver, then change accordingly.

Grip is a gtk-based cd-player and cd-ripper. It has the ripping
capabilities of cdparanoia builtin, but can also use external rippers
(such as cdda2wav).

This is an older version of Grip that does not require GNOME.

Although a .desktop file is included for KDE menu integration, this
package is mainly intended for non-KDE environments (since KDE includes
its own CD-ripping facilities, this package would be redundant anyway).

Before running grip for the first time, you may want to copy the file
"/usr/doc/grip-2.96/dot.grip.sample" to "$HOME/.grip". This sets the
default encoder to oggenc, and puts the track number at the front of
each output filename.

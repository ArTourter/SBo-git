madwifi - a Linux kernel device driver for Wireless LAN chipsets from Atheros.

A wireless card compatibility matrix is available at:
http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility

By default the script will build the madwifi kernel module for the currently
running kernel.  If you would like to build the madwifi driver for a different
kernel version, two things are required:
    1) kernel source in /usr/src/linux-<version>
    2) run the script as: KERNELVERSION=<version> sh madwifi-driver.SlackBuild
In place of <version> use only the version as you would see from the output of
'uname -r' when running that kernel.  Example: KERNELVERSION=2.6.31.1-smp

The kernel module will then be installed to /lib/modules/<version>/....
You may use this SlackBuild to build the madwifi module for as many *different*
kernels as you like and they can be installed alongside each other without
conflict.

This requires madwifi-tools from SlackBuilds.org.

Matchbox is a lightweight environment for the X Window System, that 
is specifically designed for embedded platforms such as handhelds
and set-top boxes.

This is a build for the common files that are shared between Matchbox 
applications. It does not require other packages, but isn't particularly
useful without matchbox-desktop or matchbox-panel. 

This requires libmatchbox.

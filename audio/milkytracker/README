This is MilkyTracker 0.90.80. MilkyTracker is an audio tracker, and can create
standard .MOD and .XM module files. ALSA is required. JACK is not required,
though support is available. If you have JACK and would like to use it with
MilkyTracker, add --with-jack to the configuration options in the SlackBuild
script.

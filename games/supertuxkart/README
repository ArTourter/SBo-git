SuperTuxKart is a Free 3d kart racing game; we want to make
the game fun more than we want to make it realistic. You can
play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each
other or just try to beat the computer. (a network multiplayer
feature is under development).

Requires: plib, OpenAL and freealut.

Optional: supertuxkart-extra-karts and supertuxkart-extra-tracks.

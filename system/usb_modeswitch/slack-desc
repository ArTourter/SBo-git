# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

usb_modeswitch:
usb_modeswitch: Several new USB devices (especially high-speed wireless WAN stuff,
usb_modeswitch: there seems to be a chipset from Qualcomm offering that feature)
usb_modeswitch: have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when plugged in for the
usb_modeswitch: first time they act like a flash storage and start installing the
usb_modeswitch: driver from there. After that (and on every consecutive plugging)
usb_modeswitch: this driver switches the mode internally, the storage device vanishes
usb_modeswitch: (in most cases), and a new device (like an USB modem) shows up.

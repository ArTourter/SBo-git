Deluge is a bittorrent client for  Linux and other Unix-Like operating
systems. Deluge was created because of the lack of a good, native, GTK based
torrent solution for Linux.

Deluge requires boost from Slackware and libtorrent-rasterbar, pyxdg,
pysetuptools, python-twisted, zope.interface, pyOpenSSL, chardet, Mako and
optionaly notify-python that can be found in SlackBuilds.org repository.

Mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font into a
PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font).  Type1 fonts offer many
advantages over bitmaps, as they allow PostScript files to render correctly on
printers with many resolutions.  Moreover, Ghostscript can generate much
better PDF, if given scalable fonts.

Dependencies:
* A tracing program
  autotrace >= 0.30 (http://autotrace.sourceforge.net)
  or potrace (http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
  Potrace is recommended as it runs quicker than autotrace, and it is
  also available from SlackBuilds.org.
* t1utils (also available at SlackBuilds.org)
* FontForge is recommended.

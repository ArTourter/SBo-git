# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cpufrequtils: for userspace tools and programs to the cpufreq core and drivers
cpufrequtils: in the Linux kernel. This allows for code reduction in userspace

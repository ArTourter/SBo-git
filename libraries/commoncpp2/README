GNU Common C++ is a portable and highly optimized class framework for
writing C++ applications that need to use threads.

This framework offers a class foundation that hides platform
differences from your C++ application so that you need not write
platform specific code. GNU Common C++ has been ported to compile
natively on most platforms which support either posix threads, or on
Microsoft Windows.

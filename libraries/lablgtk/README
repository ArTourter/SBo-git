LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to gtk+/gtk+-2

LablGTK uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly 
typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. 

This requires ocaml, and some optional dependencies are libgnomecanvas,
libgnomeui, and gtksourceview.

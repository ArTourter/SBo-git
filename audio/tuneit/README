tuneit (A simple command-line instrument tuner)

Tune-it uses two different algorithms for pitch detection.  By default,
a simple and fast Schmitt Trigger based algorithm is used to detect the
fundamental frequency of an instrument.  For better and more reliable
results, there is an alternative FFT based algorithm which is much more
CPU intensive.

As audio capture backends, ALSA and JACK are supported.  By default, tuneit
will try to use the hw:0,0 ALSA device.

This requires fftw.  jack is an optional dependency, but enabled by default
in this build script.  If you don't want jack support, then run the script
with USE_JACK=no in the build environment.

Tip: Unless you're on a really slow ancient system, you probably want
to always run tuneit with the -f option.

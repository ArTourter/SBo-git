# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

commons-daemon:
commons-daemon: The scope of this package is to define an API in line with
commons-daemon: the current Java(tm) Platform APIs to support an alternative
commons-daemon: invocation mechanism which could be used instead of the above
commons-daemon: mentioned public static void main(String[]) method. This
commons-daemon: specification cover the behavior and life cycle of what we
commons-daemon: define as Java(tm) daemons, or, in other words, non
commons-daemon: interactive Java(tm) applications.

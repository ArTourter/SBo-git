Exaile is a music manager and player for GTK+ written in Python. It 
incorporates automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries, 
lyrics fetching, artist/album information via Wikipedia, and Last.fm 
submission support.

This requires gst-plugins-good, gst-python, and mutagen.

Optional dependencies are gst-plugins-ugly (for mp3 support), 
cddb-p (for audio CD playback), gst-gnome-vfs (for SHOUTcast support),
webkit, pywebkitgtk (for contextual informations about the track) and 
streamripper (to record streams).

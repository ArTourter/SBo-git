Pngcrush is an optimizer for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files. Its
main purpose is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT datastream by trying
various compression levels an PNG filter methods. It also can be used to
remove unwanted ancillary chunks, or to add certain chunks including
gAMA, tRNS, iCCP, and textual chunks.

Note
-------
This package builds the "nolib" version of pngcrush which assumes you
have zlib and libpng installed (both are stock Slackware packages).

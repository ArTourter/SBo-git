Gens/GS is a Sega Genesis/CD/32x emulator forked from Gens. 

The project's main goal is to clean up the source code and combine features 
of the various Gens forks, as well as improve portability to other platforms.

To build without OpenGL, run the script with OPENGL=no.
To build with the yasm assembler instead of nasm, run the script with NASM=no.

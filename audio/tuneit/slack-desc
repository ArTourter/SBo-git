# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tuneit: Tune-it uses two different algorithms for pitch detection.  By default,
tuneit: a simple and fast Schmitt Trigger based algorithm is used to detect
tuneit: the fundamental frequency of an instrument.  For better and more
tuneit: reliable results, there is an alternative FFT based algorithm which
tuneit: is much more CPU intensive.

JAG is an arcade-puzzle 2D game which runs on Linux and Windows.
It is free and opensource.

To use additional themes download them from
http://jag.xlabsoft.com/themes.php
and put them in the same directory as jag.SlackBuild. The
slackbuild will pick them up and install them for you.

There is also an optional level editor that can be installed.
To install the editor pass JAG_EDITOR="yes" to the slackbuild.

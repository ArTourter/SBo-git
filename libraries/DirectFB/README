DirectFB is a thin library that provides developers with hardware
graphics acceleration, input device handling and abstraction,
integrated windowing system with support for translucent windows and
multiple display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device. It is
a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying
hardware.

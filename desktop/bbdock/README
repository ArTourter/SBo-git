BBDock is an application launcher for Blackbox (and others) that allows you to
create application buttons in the slit/dock.  It works with PNG files rather
than XPM images.  It supports alpha blending at 16, 24 and 32 bits color-depth.
Also, the raise-window function is available to window managers which implement
the EWMH specification.

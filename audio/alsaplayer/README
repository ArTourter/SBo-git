AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player. It is heavily multi-threaded
and tries to excercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit. It
has some very interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players. The
goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for playback of all
sorts of media with the focus on PCM audio data.

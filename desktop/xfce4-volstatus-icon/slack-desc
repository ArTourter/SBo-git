# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xfce4-volstatus-icon: This is a program that sits around and does nothing 
xfce4-volstatus-icon: until a removable volume is inserted, and then it 
xfce4-volstatus-icon: becomes an icon in the systray, which allows you to
xfce4-volstatus-icon: easily (and safely) unmount/eject the volume.

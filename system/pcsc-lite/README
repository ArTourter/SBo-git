PC/SC-lite (Personal Computer/Smart Card interface)

This is a middleware to access a smart card using SCard API (PC/SC) Its purpose
is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small form factor for 
communicating to smart cards and readers.

Compiling with "DEBUGATR=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" enables ATR parsing debug 
output messages.  Compiling with "APIDOC=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" produces 
API .pdf documentation (mainly intended for developers).

pcsc-lite uses libusb for smart-card reader's detection. If you want to
avoid usb polling (according to upstream's advice), you can compile with
"HALD=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" in order to use libhal for detecting your
reader.

NOTE: drivers are not included and must be compiled and installed separately. 
See DRIVERS file in pcsc-lite's doc directory for more information on getting
and installing specific drivers.  pcsc-lite is compiled with the 
--enable-usbdropdir=<libdir>/pcsc/drivers flag -- this directory will be the 
destination for usb readers' drivers (ccid, cardman, and others).

For serial and pcmcia readers only, it is necessary to edit files in 
/etc/reader.conf.d/ and run "/usr/sbin/update-reader.conf".

To start PC/SC-lite daemon, run "/etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd start".
For pcmcia readers, this daemon should be started after rc.pcmcia - this is 
most easily accomplished by adding the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd start
	fi

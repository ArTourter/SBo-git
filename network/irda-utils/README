IrDA-Utils (manage and control infrared devices) 

This package contains various user space utilities which control 
IrDA stack and a bunch of little programs serving as examples and 
tools for IrDA applications.

If you want to enable SIR mode connections at startup, adjust the 
serial port of you IrDA in /etc/rc.d/rc.irda, make it executable
with  'chmod +x rc.irda' and add the following lines to your rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.irda ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.irda start
  fi

If you are unsure which serial port to choose, 'dmesg | grep tty' may
point you to the right direction.

For detailed instructions on how to enable FIR mode, see 'man 8 irattach'
and README.irattach in the doc directory.

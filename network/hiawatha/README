Hiawatha (A secure and advanced webserver)

Hiawatha is a secure webserver for Unix. It has been written with
'being secure' as its main goal. Hiawatha has lots of features that
no other webserver has. This and the fact that Hiawatha's source
code is free of security-bugs, makes Hiawatha the most secure
webserver available.

bsnes is an emulator that began development on 2004-10-14. The
purpose of this emulator is a bit different from others: it
focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean code.

The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As
a result, the minimum system requirements for bsnes are very high.

bsnes requires OpenAL.

Optional build requirement is pulseaudio.  By default pulseaudio
is turned off.  To build bsnes with pulseaudio support pass
USE_PULSE="yes" to the slackbuild.

If you happen to use a version of Slackware that is less then 13.0
and you have Qt >= 4.5.0 then you need to pass OLD_SLACK="yes" to
the slackbuild.

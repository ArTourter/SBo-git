OpenArena is an open-source content package for Quake III Arena licensed under
the GPL, effectively creating a free stand-alone game.  You do not need Quake
III Arena to play this game.

OpenArena has bots, network playability, many maps and most of the other
features you would expect from a commercial first person shooter.

OpenArena requires the OpenAL library found on SlackBuilds.org.  It also
requires 3D accelerated video drivers but runs quite well on the open-source
Intel drivers.

Although the $VERSION is listed as 0.8.1, this script actually builds OpenArena
0.8.1 plus the 0.8.5 patch (which is the latest version as of April 14, 2010).

Please be advised that the main game zip file, oa080.zip, is about 309MB, and
the oa085p.zip patch is another 40MB.  Also, the download site listed in the
openarena.info file is a direct link, but it is very, very slow.  You may wish
to visit the openarena homepage (openarena.ws), click on "Files," and look for
much faster download sites that do not offer direct links.

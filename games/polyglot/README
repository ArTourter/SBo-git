Polyglot is a chess engine protocol adaptor

Common chess frontends have a winboard/xboard input interface,
modern chess engines speak the UCI "universal chess interface"
protocol. This protocol adaptor makes it possible to use standard
chess frontends, like xboard or scid with UCI speaking engines
and play chess against them.

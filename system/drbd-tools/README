drbd (Distributed Replicated Block Device)

DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability
clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via
(a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network RAID1. DRBD
takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to
the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.

Starting with Linux 2.6.33, DRBD is officially integrated into the
vanilla Linux kernel source. Besides the kernel integration, DRBD
continues to be developed out of tree.

This SlackBuild compiles the userland tools for working with DRBD.
If you have a 2.6.33 kernel or later then you will need to ensure
DRBD has been configured in your kernel.  If you have an earlier
kernel, then you will need the drbd-kernel package.

ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features
to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a smaller
footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this by not using
the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the
configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name
implies, or in any other X environment.

ROXTerm uses the "session" bus, which should be started along with your
desktop environment. Current versions of ROX, GNOME, and KDE session
managers all launch D-BUS. If you use some other session/desktop/window
manager which doesn't launch D-BUS you can start it by inserting something
like this near the start of your .xinitrc or .xsession:

  if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then
    eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
    export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
  fi

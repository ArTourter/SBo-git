The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and
industry partners.  Open MPI is therefore able to combine the experise,
technologies, and resources from all across the High Performance
Computing community in order to build the best MPI library available.
Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application
developers and computer science researchers.

Open MPI represents the merger between three well-known MPI implementations:
    * FT-MPI from the University of Tennessee
    * LA-MPI from Los Alamos National Laboratory
    * LAM/MPI from Indiana University
with contributions from the PACX-MPI team at the University of Stuttgart.  
These four institutions comprise the founding members of the Open MPI 
development team.  Each of these MPI implementations excelled in one or more 
areas.  The driving motivation behind Open MPI is to bring the best ideas 
and technologies from the individual projects and create one world-class open 
source MPI implementation that excels in all areas.

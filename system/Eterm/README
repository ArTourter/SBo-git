Eterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator with enhanced graphical
capabilities.  Eterm is intended to be a replacement for xterm for
Enlightenment window manager users, but it can also be used as a
replacement for xterm by users without Enlightenment.  Eterm supports
various themes and is very configurable, in keeping with the
philosophy of Enlightenment. 

This requires imlib2 and libast.

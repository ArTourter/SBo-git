pdksh: PD-ksh is a clone of the AT&T Korn shell.
pdksh: 
pdksh: PD-ksh has most of the ksh88 features, not much of the ksh93 features,
pdksh: and a number of its own features.
pdksh: Strong points are: 
pdksh: It is free and quite portable - you should be able to compile it easily
pdksh: on pretty much any unix box. 
pdksh: The vi editing mode is better (IMHO) than that of ksh88 or ksh93
pdksh: (command/file completion using tab (optional), less buggy). 
pdksh: Its weak points are that there are still a few differences from ksh88.

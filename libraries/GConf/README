GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the Windows 
registry and annoying in the same manner.  It was written for the GNOME 
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME is not 
installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.

This requires ORBit2.

SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.  SQLObject includes a 
Python-object-based query language that makes SQL more abstract, and 
provides substantial database independence for applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB
(SAPDB).

NOTE: Requires pysetuptools and FormEncode

NOTE: SQLObject checks for supported databases at run time.
Following Python modules are needed for the actual databases: MySQLdb
for MySQL, psycopg or pgdb for PostresSQL, pysqlite for SQLite,
kinterbasdb for Firebird, Sybase for Sybase, adodbapi or pymssql for
MSSQL, and sapdb for MaxDB.

haskell-editline (Bindings to the editline library (libedit))

This package contains bindings to the BSD editline library.  It provides a 
basic interface to the editline API for reading lines of input from the user.
Additionally, a readline compatibility module is included which provides a 
subset of the functions from the readline package.

This requires libedit and ghc.

When uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg unregister editline

tovid is a collection of GPL video disc authoring tools; it can help you
create your own DVDs, VCDs, and SVCDs for playback on your home DVD player.
The CLI scripts are particularly handy for automating disc creation.

Depends on: txt2tags, mjpegtools, ffmpeg, wxPython, dvdauthor, vcdimager,
and transcode (all available on SlackBuilds.org).

DCRaw is software for processing RAW image files generated by a host of
digital cameras.  DCRaw by itself only provides a command line interface
for image processing.  DCRaw can also build with a gimp plugin so images
can be edited/exported with gimp - if you want to build the gimp plugin,
then run the build script with the "rawphoto" argument:
  ./dcraw.SlackBuild rawphoto

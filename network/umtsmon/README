A program to control your UMTS (and GPRS/EDGE) card: enter SIM
PIN code, send and receive SMS and control/monitor the network
connection.

To make umtsmon work with Slackware you have to either manually
set /usr/sbin/pppd suid root, or run umtsmon with sudo or as root.

This requires the qt3 compat libs from /extra.

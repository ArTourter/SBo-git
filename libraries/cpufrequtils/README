"libcpufreq" is a library which offers a unified access method for userspace
tools and programs to the cpufreq core and drivers in the Linux kernel. This
allows for code reduction in userspace tools, a clean implementation of
the interaction to the cpufreq core, and support for both the sysfs and proc
interfaces [depending on configuration].
"cpufreq-info" determines current cpufreq settings, and provides useful
debug information to users and bug-hunters.
"cpufreq-set" allows to set a specific frequency and/or new cpufreq policies
without having to type "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq" all the time.

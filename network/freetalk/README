Freetalk is a GPLv3 console (command line) based Jabber client.  It will 
enable you to chat with other Jabber users as well as users of services 
using the Jabber protocol, like Google Chat.

Freetalk features a readline interface with completion of buddy names, 
commands, and even ordinary English words.  Freetalk is extensible, 
configurable, and scriptable through a Guile interface.

This requires loudmouth, and beep is an optional dependency.

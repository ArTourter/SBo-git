clam_networkeditor (tool for editing CLAM processing networks)

The CLAM Network Editor is a tool for editing CLAM processing networks.
Those processing networks can become the processing core of an application
by using the CLAM::NetworkPlayer class in your program or by using
the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer interface.

A CLAM processing network is a network of virtual audio components which
modify an audio signal (much like an effects processor).

This requires clam.

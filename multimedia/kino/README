Kino is a non-linear DV editor for GNU/Linux.

It features excellent integration with IEEE 1394 for capture, VTR
control, and recording back to the camera. It captures video to disk
in raw DV or AVI format in both type-1 DV and type-2 DV (separate
audio stream) encodings.

Kino does not support other video file formats or encodings, but it
can import them by transcoding with FFmpeg and optionally MEncoder.

This requires libavc1394, libiec61883, libdv, libsamplerate and ffmpeg. 
If you want support for quicktime, you'll have to pass QUICKTIME=yes 
to the script. This will additionally require liquicktime.
All dependencies are available from SlackBuilds.org.

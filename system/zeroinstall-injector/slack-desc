# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zeroinstall-injector: zeroinstall-injector (The Zero Install Injector)
zeroinstall-injector:
zeroinstall-injector: A running process is created by combining many different
zeroinstall-injector: libraries (and other components). In the Zero Install 
zeroinstall-injector: world, we have all versions of each library available at
zeroinstall-injector: all times. The problem is then choosing which to use.
zeroinstall-injector:
zeroinstall-injector: The injector solves this problem by selecting components 
zeroinstall-injector: to meet a program's requirements according to user policy.
zeroinstall-injector: The injector finds out which versions are available and 
zeroinstall-injector: downloads and runs the ones you choose.

rar is a command line utitility used to create RAR archives in Linux.

Since the source code isn't available, this SlackBuild packages the 
official binary.  

This is only an evaluation copy.
If you wish to use RAR after the evaluation period of 40 days, you will
have to purchase its license: http://www.rarlab.com/registration.php

To include unrar in the package, run the script like this:
UNRAR=yes ./rar.SlackBuild

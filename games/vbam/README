Our goal is to improve upon VisualBoyAdvance by integrating
the best features from the various builds floating around. 
Unfortunately work on the "official" project seems to have 
stalled. Independent developers have added excellent 
features to VBA, but seem to have done so individually. The 
source codes for many of these forks seem to be abandoned, 
outdated or missing altogether. We aim to preserve all of 
the hard work done by these developers to make the already
great VisualBoyAdvance even better!

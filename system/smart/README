Smart Package Manager is a next generation package handling tool
to work with every major distribution's packages.  This is the
backend used by kde4's "kpackage" utility.

Note that this isn't terribly good at handling Slackware package
management tasks, so if anyone is adept with python, please 
consider contributing some enhancements upstream.

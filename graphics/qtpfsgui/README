Qtpfsgui is an HDR imaging tool.  It creates an HDR file from a set
of images (JPEG, TIFF 8 and 16 bit, RAW) of the same scene taken at
different exposure settings.  You can save and load HDR images,
rotate and resize them, tonemap your images, and copy your EXIF data.

Qtpfsgui requires fftw, which is also available from SlackBuilds.org.

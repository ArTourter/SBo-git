gazpacho (Next Generation GUI Design)

This program allows you to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
of your GTK+ program in a visual way. It started as a Glade-3 clone 
but now it is more complete and featured than its ancestor. It tries
to be compatible with libglade but it can handle some widgets that 
still lack support in libglade.

This requires kiwi.

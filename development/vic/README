vic is a simple wrapper around the editor of your choice to first check a 
file out of RCS, edit the file, and then check the file back into RCS.

There are safeguards to protect the user if the file is edited outside of RCS,
and it allows the user to get the RCS archive back up to date.

You can edit multiple programs at a time with something like: vic *.wc

The editor name is drawn from the environment variables $VISUAL, $EDITOR, or
(if all else fails) "vi".

Also included is a simple program, show.locks, which shows all of the files 
from the current directory which are currently locked.

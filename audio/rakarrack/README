rakarrack (realtime audio effects processor)

Rakarrack is a virtual digitial effects rack, including such effects as
distortion, echo, reverb, phaser, flanger, chorus, compressor, etc.

This package requires fltk and jack-audio-connection-kit; two optional
(but highly recommended) dependencies are qjackctl and set_rlimits.

SopCast is a simple, free way to broadcast video and audio or watch the video 
and listen to radio on the Internet.  Adopting P2P(Peer-to-Peer) technology, 
it is very efficient and easy to use.  Let anyone become a broadcaster 
without the costs of a powerful server and vast bandwidth.  You can build 
your own TV stations comparable with large commercial sites with minimal 
resources.  Using SopCast, you can serve 10,000 online users with a personal 
computer and a home broadband connection.

SoP is the abbreviation for Streaming over P2P.  Sopcast is a Streaming 
Direct Broadcasting System based on P2P. The core is the communication 
protocol produced by Sopcast Team, which is named sop://, or SoP technology.

This is the command line version of sopcast, but a gtk gui frontend called
"gsopcast" is also available at SlackBuilds.org.

This appears to be a binary-only deal, and there isn't one for x86_64.

See README.SLACKWARE for initial setup and configuration hints.

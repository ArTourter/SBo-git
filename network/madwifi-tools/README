MadWifi - a Linux kernel device driver for Wireless LAN chipsets from Atheros.

A wireless card compatibility matrix is available at:
http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility

This SlackBuild builds the madwifi tools, not the kernel module.  You will
need to use the "madwifi-driver" SlackBuild to build the madwifi module for
your kernel version.

Blogging client, focused on simplicity and usability.

Currently there is no support for adding categories from the Bilbo client.

Due to trademark issues Bilbo v1.0 is the last release by this name,
Blogilo is the new project name.  You can visit the project's homepage

Blogilo is also now part of the official KDE PIM
project, replacing KBlogger.

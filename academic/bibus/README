Bibus is a bibliographic and reference management software.  As with other 
such tools, Bibus allows one to search, edit, and sort bibliographic records.
In addition, Bibus contains features that makes it unique among open source 
and even commercial bibliographic databases.

This is built to work with the openoffice.org package on SlackBuilds.org.

This requires wxPython.

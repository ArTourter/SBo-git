libflashsupport is an additional library for Adobe Flash Player adding
support for TLS, OSS and optionally PulseAudio.
This library is known to solve problems about missing audio from Flash
content, like videos embedded into web pages.

To build with PulseAudio support, start the script with PULSE=yes, as
in:
  PULSE=yes ./libflashsupport.SlackBuild
This requires that you have already installed pulseaudio, available
from SlackBuilds.org.

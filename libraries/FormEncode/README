FormEncode (HTML form validation, generation, and conversion package)

FormEncode validates and converts nested structures.  It allows for a
declarative form of defining the validation, and decoupled processes
for filling and generating forms.

NOTE: To build this package, setuptools needs to be installed
(available at SlackBuilds.org as "pysetuptools").

NOTE: Running the test suite requires nose.

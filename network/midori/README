Midori is a lightweight, webkit-based web browser.

Since midori is still in heavy development, an "updated" version
can be grabbed via. git and making minor changes to the buildscript:

git clone http://software.twotoasts.de/media/midori.git midori

Note: To build midori, libsexy, libunique and webkit are required, all of 
which are available at slackbuilds.org.

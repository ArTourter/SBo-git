Periscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that tries to find
a correct match for a given video file.  The subtitles sites are handled as
plugins and currently support OpenSubtitles, SubtitleSource, Podnapisi,
Subscene and Subtitulos.

A python/nautilus integration script is copied to the doc directory.

The program requires pysetuptools for building and BeautifulSoup to run. A rar
unpacker is recommended but can be avoided if you disable the plugins for
subtitles sites using this format.

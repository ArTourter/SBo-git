# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

drbd-kernel: drbd-kernel (Kernel Module for Distributed Replicated Block Device)
drbd-kernel:
drbd-kernel: DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability
drbd-kernel: clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via
drbd-kernel: (a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network RAID1. DRBD
drbd-kernel: takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to
drbd-kernel: the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.
drbd-kernel:
drbd-kernel: This package provides the DRBD kernel module for pre-2.6.33 kernels.

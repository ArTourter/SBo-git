MythTV is a GPL licensed suite of programs that allow you to build the 
mythical home media convergence box on your own using Open Source software 
and operating systems. MythTV is known to work on Linux and Mac OS X 
(PowerPC and Intel).

See README.SLACKWARE after installation for setup information.

This requires yasm and lame, and optionally xmltv_prereq, xmltv, and lirc.

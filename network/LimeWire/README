LimeWire is a cross-platform, open-source peer-to-peer filesharing client.  
This is essentially a repackaging of the official binary from limewire.com. 

Note that the filename of the LimeWireOther.zip file does *not* change
with newer releases, so make sure you keep that in mind when you're 
verifying md5sums; if they don't match, a newer version might have been
released.

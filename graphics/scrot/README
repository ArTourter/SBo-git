scrot is a commandline screen capture util like "import", but using imlib2.
It has lots of options for autogenerating filenames, and can do fun stuff 
like taking screenshots of multiple displays and glueing them together.

NOTE: scrot requires giblib and imlib2, both available on SlackBuilds.org.
When compiling, the order must be imlib2, then giblib, then scrot.

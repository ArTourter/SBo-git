# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

qdoc3: qdoc3 (tool used to generate the Qt reference documentation)
qdoc3: 
qdoc3: qdoc3 is obsolete.  It *was* the tool to generate the Qt reference
qdoc3: documentation, but it is still contained in the Qt package due to the
qdoc3: GPL.  If you're interested in building Qt Creator, you'll probably 
qdoc3: need qdoc3 to build its documentation.

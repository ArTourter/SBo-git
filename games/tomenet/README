Tales of Middle Earth Multiplayer is a fantasy adventure game
 
TomeNET is a multiplayer fantasy dungeon exploration game based on the works of
J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a game that emphasizes intricate, challenging, and varied
gameplay over graphics. Hundreds of different monsters in randomly-generated,
unpredictable dungeons will strive to slay you by various means

The game is installed in /usr/share/games/tomenet, where the configuration
files are.  The SlackBuild links the clients (for playing) into /usr/games and
the server and administration utilities into /usr/bin.  Slackware already puts
these places in your path, so you can type the name of the programs anywhere
and run them.  The clients are called:

tomenet (for the X Window system. recommended)
tomenet.console (for the linux console, but it may not have as many features
such as windows to show other players.)

The server and administration utliities are:

tomenetd
tomenetd.evilmeta (for joining the list of public servers)
tomenetd.accedit (to edit user accounts.)

Just type in the client name and it will give you a list of servers.  If you
want to run one, type tomenetd and--if you want it public--tomenetd.evilmeta.
The tomenet.accedit will let you set what type of account (normal, Dungeon
Master, admin) specific users get who connect.

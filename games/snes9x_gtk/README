Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES
and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation. The
games include some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

Snes9x_Gtk is an unofficial port of Snes9x with a GTK+ graphical frontend.

This SlackBuild works on both 32-bit and 64-bit Slackware systems.

Note: the README in the source tarball is apparently outdated: it claims
gtkglext and portaudio are required dependencies, but they aren't.

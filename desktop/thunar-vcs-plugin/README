The Thunar VCS Plugin adds Subversion and GIT actions to the context
menu of Thunar. This gives a SVN integration and GIT integration to
Thunar.

The git functionality is still very much a work in progress, so don't
expect much for now; however, the svn functionality should be the
same as what was provided by thunar-svn-plugin.

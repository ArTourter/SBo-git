# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pdksh: PD-ksh (a clone of the AT&T Korn shell)
pdksh: 
pdksh: PD-ksh has most of the ksh88 features, not much of the ksh93 features,
pdksh: and a number of its own features.
pdksh: Strong points are: 
pdksh: It is free and quite portable - you should be able to compile it
pdksh: easily on pretty much any unix box. 
pdksh: The vi editing mode is better (IMHO) than that of ksh88 or ksh93
pdksh: (command/file completion using tab (optional), less buggy). 
pdksh: Its weak points are that there are still a few differences from ksh88.

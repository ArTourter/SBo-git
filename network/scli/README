SNMP Command Line Interface

The scli package was written to address the need for small and efficient
command line utilities to monitor and configure network devices and host
systems. The scli package is based on the SNMP management protocol. It
utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to generate C stub code.

scli connects to any SNMP-enabled network node and lets you interactively
browse through the values stored in the devices SNMP database (MIB, Management
Information Base). It also has a scriptable, non-interactive mode.

This requires gnet and gsnmp.

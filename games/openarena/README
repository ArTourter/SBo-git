OpenArena is an open-source content package for Quake III Arena
licensed under the GPL, effectively creating a free stand-alone game.
You do not need Quake III Arena to play this game.

OpenArena has bots, network playability, many maps and most of the
other features you would expect from a commercial first person
shooter.

OpenArena requires the OpenAL library found on SlackBuilds.org.  It
also requires 3D accelerated video drivers but runs quite well on the
open-source Intel drivers.

Please be advised that the main game zip file, oa080.zip, is about
309MB.  Also, the download site listed in the openarena.info file is a
direct link, but it is very, very slow.  You may wish to visit the
openarena homepage (openarena.ws), click on "Files," and look for
much faster download sites that do not offer direct links.

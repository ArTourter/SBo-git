KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT
or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides
the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although
work is underway to get the required changes upstream.

Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux
or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware:
a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

If you'd like to build this for a kernel other than the one you're currently
running, you can do something like this:
	KERNELVERSION=2.6.27.15 ./kvm.SlackBuild

This script requires a 'kvm' group to exist before running. The recommended
GID is 221. You can create it like this:   groupadd -g 221 kvm
		 
After installation, add user to kvm group and re-login. Don't forget to load
kernel module kvm-intel (or kvm-amd if you use AMD processors). 

NOTE: if 2.6.30.* or 2.6.31.* kernels are used uncomment appropriate string
      in slackbild.

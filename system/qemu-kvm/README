KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V).  KVM requires QEMU-KVM to create and run virtual
machines (e.g. Windows, Linux, BSD) under full system emulation or user
mode emulation.  QEMU-KVM is a slightly modified QEMU designed to work
with KVM kernel modules.

KVM consists of a loadable kernel module, 'kvm.ko', that provides the
core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
'kvm-intel.ko' or 'kvm-amd.ko'.  For improved performance QEMU-KVM also
works with 'virtio' modules.  Slackware provides pre-built 'kvm' and
'virtio' modules that work with this package.

After package installation, add a 'kvm' group and add a user to the
'kvm' group and re-login.  Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or
'kvm-amd' module depending on your processor.

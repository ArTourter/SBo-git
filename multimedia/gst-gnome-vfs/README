GStreamer plugin for gnome-vfs
     
GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. 
It supports a range of applications; from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video 
streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.   
 
This package contains the GStreamer plugin for Gnome Virtual File System.

This requires gnome-vfs.

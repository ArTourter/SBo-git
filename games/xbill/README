The xbill game tests your reflexes as you seek out and destroy all
forms of Bill, establish a new operating system throughout the
universe, and boldly go where no geek has gone before.  Xbill has
become an increasingly attractive option as the Linux Age progresses,
and it is very popular at Red Hat.

NOTE:
Per default xbill sets its score file world writable
which obviously allows cheating ones hi-score :-(
Probably this came about since GTK+ doesn't allow setgid?
 
In the install-script we move xbill to xbill-bin and install
a wrapper thingy as xbill instead. In the resulting package
/var/games/xbill is group-writable for 'games' only...

Note on capabilities: FCAPS=true
This is the default now. It maybe disabled by feeding a 'false'
value to the build script and the wrapper will be installed with
setuid and video group executable filesystem perms. As before.
Just comment it out, if you don't care for any of this stuff :-)

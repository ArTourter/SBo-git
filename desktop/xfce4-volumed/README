xfce4-volumed (audio volume management daemon)

This daemon is responsible of making the volume up/down and mute keys of 
the keyboard work automatically, and uses the XFCE 4 mixer's defined card
and track for choosing which track to act on. It also provides volume change
and mute toggle notifications if the notification daemon is running.

This requires libnotify.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libv4l: libv4l (video4linux abstraction library)
libv4l:
libv4l: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction
libv4l: layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin)
libv4l: layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide
libv4l: variety of devices without having to write seperate code for
libv4l: different devices in the same class.

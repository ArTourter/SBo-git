Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive
tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 3500 potentially
dangerous files/CGIs, versions on over 900 servers, and version specific
problems on over 250 servers. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and
can be automatically updated (if desired).

This requires libwhisker2 and Net-SSLeay.

WARNING: if you're updating from 2.03 to 2.1.0, keep in mind that the config
file has been changed from the old location </etc/nikto/config.txt> 
(a debianism I introduced to work around the config.txt unspecified location)
to the newer, official location at /etc/nikto.conf

Speaking of debianisms, I removed the symolic link /usr/bin/nikto creation;
upgradepkg will not remove it, but newer installs will not have it any more.
If you like the link and want to retain it in future updates, just uncomment 
the needed lines inside the SlackBuild.

(Unix-like environments) through the interpretation of its own declarative
language. It emphasizes an 'immunological' viewpoint, making its modus
operandi convergence to a stable state.

Note: Even though an rc file is included, at least an update.conf is needed
as well. A sample for which is included. For usage intros see:

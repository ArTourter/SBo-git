perl-tk (Tk graphical interface for Perl)

Perl/Tk is an extension for writing Perl programs with a Graphical User (GUI) 
on both Unix and Windows 95/NT.  Tk was originally developed as an extension 
to the Tcl language, for use with the X Window System on Unix. With its port 
to Perl, Tk gives Perl programmers the same control over a graphical desktop 
that Tcl programmers have taken for granted.

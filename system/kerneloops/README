kerneloops (client to collect kernel oops data)

This package contains the tools to collect kernel crash signatures,
and to submit them to the kerneloops.org website where the kernel
crash signatures get collected and grouped for presentation to the
Linux kernel developers.

This requires libnotify, which is also available from SlackBuilds.org.

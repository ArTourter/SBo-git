abcde is a frontend command-line utility (actually, a shell script)
that grabs tracks off a CD encodes them to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC,
OGG/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack) and/or M4A/AAC format, and tags them 
all in one go.

abcde requires cd-discid which can be found on Slackbuilds.org. There 
are many features that abcde supports and many of these packages can 
be also found on Slackbuilds.org:

* faac       : for creating m4a/aac files
* id3lib     : for manipulating ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags
* id3v2      : for writing id3v2 tags
* lame       : for creating mp3 files
* mppenc     : for creating MPP/MP+(Musepack) files 
* speex      : for creating Speex files
* vorbisgain : for adjusting the volume of ogg vorbis files

Try running abcde as root (sudo or whatever) if abcde/cd-discid thinks 
your favorite audio cd is a data cd. Please note also that faac needs 
to have mp4 support enabled to work correctly with abcde.

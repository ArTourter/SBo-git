atarisio (disk emulator for use with Atari 8-bit computer and SIO2PC)

AtariSIO allows a Linux system to act as one or more disk drives,
a printer, and/or a cassette drive for an Atari 8-bit (400/800/XL/XE)
computer, using an SIO2PC cable.

Even without SIO2PC or a real Atari, this package includes some utilities
that are useful for manipulating and examining Atari disk, tape, and
executable images.

A real 16550A UART (or close derivative) is required. In particular,
atarisio does NOT work with USB to RS232 adaptors.

Before you can run atariserver or atarixfer, you will need the atarisio
kernel module loaded. If you're dedicating a serial port for use with
atariserver, you can add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules or
rc.local (as you prefer):

/sbin/modprobe atarisio port=/dev/ttyS0

(Replace ttyS0 if you're using a different serial port, of course)

If you need to use your serial port for other purposes, it's a little
less cut-and-dried. You will have to either manually modprobe and rmmod
the module as needed, or write yourself a script to do the job (possibly
also starting up agetty when the module is unloaded, or SLIP mode if
you're using FujiChat on your Atari, etc etc).

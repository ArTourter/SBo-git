# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xcircuit:
xcircuit: XCircuit is a program for drawing publishable-quality electrical
xcircuit: circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, and produce circuit
xcircuit: netlists through schematic capture.  XCircuit regards circuits as
xcircuit: inherently hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical PostScript
xcircuit: output and hierarchical SPICE netlists.  Circuit components are saved 
xcircuit: in and retrieved from libraries which are fully editable.

Pandoc is a command-line tool for converting from one markup format to
another. It can read markdown and (subsets of) reStructuredText, HTML,
and LaTeX, and it can write markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX,
ConTeXt, PDF, RTF, DocBook XML, OpenDocument XML, ODT, GNU Texinfo,
MediaWiki markup, groff man pages, and S5 HTML slide shows.

This requires ghc, haskell-binary, haskell-digest, haskell-zlib,
haskell-zip-archive, haskell-mtl, haskell-parsec, haskell-xhtml, and
haskell-network.

Note: Pandoc normally refuses to build with Parsec 3 as it may perform
more slowly.  This SlackBuild includes a patch to lift that restriction.
If you want Pandoc to perform as intended, install Parsec 2 first.

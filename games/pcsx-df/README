PCSX-df is a forked version of the dead PCSX emulator, with a nicer
interface and several improvements to stability and functionality.
PCSX-df has a very capable Internal HLE BIOS that can run many games
without problems. It is recommended that you use it. However, if you
own a real Playstation, you may be able to use your own BIOS image
placed under '~/.pcsx/bios'.

This package conflicts with pcsxr. Both cannot be installed at the same time!

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

commoncpp2:
commoncpp2: GNU Common C++ is a portable and highly optimized class framework for
commoncpp2: writing C++ applications that need to use threads.
commoncpp2: This framework offers a class foundation that hides platform
commoncpp2: differences from your C++ application so that you need not write
commoncpp2: platform specific code. GNU Common C++ has been ported to compile
commoncpp2: natively on most platforms which support either posix threads, or on
commoncpp2: Microsoft Windows.

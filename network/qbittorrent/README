qBittorrent : a C++ / Qt4 Bittorrent Client
 
The qBittorrent project was created in March 2006 with the idea
of developing a new Bittorrent client for Linux (and possibly
other systems) that would be easy to use, good looking, featureful
but lightweight.
qBittorrent is a Free Software released under the GNU GPL license.

One of it's useful features is the ability to search torrent sites.
The author is Christophe Dumez, a French student in an engineer
school (UTBM), in IT departement.
qBittorrent is based on the great Libtorrent by Arvid Norberg.

qBittorrent depends on QT4 and libtorrent-rasterbar >= 0.14.0

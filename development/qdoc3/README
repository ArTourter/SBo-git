qdoc3 is the tool used to generate the Qt reference documentation.

qdoc3 is obsolete.  It *was* the tool to generate the Qt reference
documentation, but it is still contained in the Qt package due to the GPL.
If you're interested in building Qt Creator, you'll probably need qdoc3 
to build its documentation.

Freeglut (OpenSourced alternative to OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT))

GLUT was originally written by Mark Kilgard to support the sample programs in 
the second edition OpenGL 'RedBook'. Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide 
variety of practical applications because it is simple, widely available and 
highly portable. GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and 
manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms.

NOTE: This package overwrites libglut.so and glut.h from the mesa package in
stock Slackware, so be sure to reinstall mesa after removing freeglut.

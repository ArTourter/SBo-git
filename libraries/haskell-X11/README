haskell-X11 (A Haskell binding to the X11 graphics library)

The binding is a direct translation of the C binding; for
documentation of these calls, refer to The Xlib Programming Manual,
available online at http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/.

This requires ghc from SlackBuilds.org.

When uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg unregister X11

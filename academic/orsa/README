ORSA is an interactive tool for scientific grade Celestial Mechanics 
computations.  Asteroids, comets, artificial satellites, Solar and 
extra-Solar planetary systems can be accurately reproduced, simulated, 
and analyzed.  This does not support Close approaches tool.
 
This requires gsl, cln, and ginac, as well as qt3 from /extra/kde3-compat/.

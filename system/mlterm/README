mlterm is a multilingual X11 terminal emulator. It supports different 
character sets, automatic selection of proper enconding, complex 
characters such as double width for East Asian and bi-direction for 
Arabic and Hebrew. 

For ISCII rendering mlterm is dependent upon the libind library.
To compile the package with libind support add "--enable-ind" 
to the configure options in the build script.

To use anti-aliased fonts select XfreeType rather than xcore, run the
script as follows: FONT_ENGINE=xft ./mlterm.SlackBuild

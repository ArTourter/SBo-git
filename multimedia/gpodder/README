gPodder is a GTK2 media aggregator

gPodder is a podcast receiver/catcher written in Python utilizing PyGTK for
its user interface.  gPodder allows the user to subscribe to RSS feeds for
podcasts, videocasts, and other similar content and download media files
found in those feeds.  gPodder has system-tray notifications, support for
optional iPod synchronization, and MP3/Ogg id3 tag editing.

This application requires python and vorbis-tools, part of the
standard Slackware installation.  It also requires feedparser and help2man,
both of which can be found here at SlackBuilds.org.  One can also enable 
optional id3 tagging and MP3-OGG conversion features by installing eyeD3,
id3lib, and lame, all of which can also be found here at
SlackBuilds.org.  Finally, some of the other features in gPodder, such
as iPod synchronization, bittorrent downloading, and Bluetooth
file-sharing are currently disabled pending future SlackBuilds for
those components.
